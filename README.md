# day-11_text_based_blackjack
Day 11 of 100

Text-based Black Jack. My first Capstone project. It is easy to feel overwhelmed at times, so the trick is to work iteratively. Lists, modules, functions, conditional statements, and loops are all present. Since the computer is the dealer, the user can only see one of the dealer's cards until the end.

These are the rules and restrictions I was presented with:
1) The deck is unlimited in size.
2) There are no jokers.
3)The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
4)The Ace can count as 11 or 1.
5) The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
6) Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
7) The computer is the dealer.
